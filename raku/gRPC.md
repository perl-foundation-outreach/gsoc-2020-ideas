Create a Raku implementation of gRPC
========================

Description
-----------

gRPC is a protocol that's used extensively, by itself or as part of
services such as etcd. For the time being, there's no Raku module that
offers a high-levle interface to it.

In this project, the student would be expected to create and release
to the Raku ecosystem a gRPC module, along with example on how to work
with it.

Expected outcomes
-----------------

* Functional version 0.1 released to the ecosystem.
* Examples included with the distribution on how to use it for
  interfacing with different services.


Required skills
---------------

Required or prefered skills the student should have to be able to
tackle this project.

* Some experience with Raku is appreciated, but not really
  needed. Will to learn will be a requisite.
* Experience in C to be able to use NativeCall for C interfacing, in
  case an adaptation of an already existing C module would be the way
  to go.


Rating
